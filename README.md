## Introduction

This is my favourite work/study method, for someone with a short attention span, it allows me to be able to focus for a longer period of time.

The [Pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) is a study method that breaks down the time spent on the task into small segments while taking short breaks so as to imporove concetration and reduce distractions.
